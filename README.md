# 573_Lead_Scouting_App

This is an Android app that must be run on an Android device running Android SDK v 31 or newer. 

This app reads QR codes from scouting tablets and stores that data in a csv file on the lead scouters phone. This can then be transferred to a laptop via a USB-C cable. 

It is important that the expected CSV input to this app and output from the scouting app match otherwise data may be missed or placed in the wrong column.
